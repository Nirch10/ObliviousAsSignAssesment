1.DDos Attack - the way the solution is built, it can be shut down with a very simple DDos attack on the server.
                in the same way, with enough tries the client eventually will guess the right key for itself to connect the server.

2.Certificate - there is a chance, with the way the certificate is stored and passed to the server on it's creation, that the certificat will be damaged or dangerous and not a real certificate.

3.Same key used - The server in this solution uses the same key generated on the first time for each client that makes a request - this means that a stolen key can be used from diferent clients as long as the server is up and running.
4.key generator as a breaking point - since the key generator has all the parameters, in case where hackers breach our keygenerator server, they posses all the information they need in order to break our secured connection


How to improve our security here :

1.Ddos attack - limit number of request per minute + ban repeated request from some ip for x time period.
                own a list of "untrusted servers", for which our server will not accept any test_connection request for a period of time.

2.Certificate - Use Apache Tomcat/IIS. this way we can make sure our certificate is valid and secured, and we have a system to manage that, so we are partly care free.

3.Same key used - We can update our server's key after a period of time / set a new key for each client (more comlexity)

4.key generator as a breaking point - store the parameters in a different place / dont save it all - after all after the ke generator generates those parameters, they are not needed anymore.

*A valid option would be using JWT, as it is being used to make sure connections are secured, it is easy to implement and maintain, well known (so new developers joining the team can understand easily),
and it take off some complexity out of solving problem number 3.
